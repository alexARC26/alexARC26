I’m Alejandro Rodríguez-Collado, a data scientist and Ph.D. in Mathematics (Statistics), passionate about using AI, Machine Learning, and Business Intelligence to solve business challenges. One of my most significant recent accomplishments is leading the rapid expansion of a data team at a real estate company. Under my leadership, the team implemented data-driven solutions for multiple clients. This significantly enhanced the company’s decision-making processes. With more than 7 years of experience, I’ve tackled projects in biomedicine, intelligent transport systems, and industry 4.0, published research in top journals, and even have written two books. I thrive on connecting technical work with business goals and am always excited for new data science opportunities.

## Projects
### 1. CO₂ Emissions: Analysis and Regression Prediction (Python)

Conducted a comprehensive analysis to predict CO2 emissions from a dataset of 7,385 Canadian vehicles. The project consists of two notebooks: (1) Exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization to clean the dataset, engineer features, and visualize relationships using boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, and correlation heatmaps; (2) Regression modeling to predict emissions using linear regression, LASSO, support vector machines, regression trees, and XGBoost. XGBoost, after hyperparameter tuning, achieved the best performance (0.998 $R^2$ and 7.400 MSE). This model could inform eco-friendly vehicle policies or consumer decision-making.
- **Techniques**: 
    - Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature engineering, normalization, categorical encoding.
    - Analysis: Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis, correlation analysis, visualization.
    - Modeling: Linear regression, LASSO regularization, SVM, regression trees, XGBoost.
    - Evaluation: Train-validation-test split, feature importance analysis, hyperparameter tuning.
- **Tools**: Python. Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, SVR, DecisionTreeRegressor), Statsmodels, XGBoost, Kagglehub.

### 2. Cats-vs.-Dogs Image Classification (Python)

Developed a model to classify cat and dog images using a dataset with a high feature-to-sample ratio (2,000 images and 67,500 features per image). The project includes preprocessing and three notebooks, each exploring a different approach: (1) Classic ML with dimensionality reduction techniques; (2) Sequential CNNs; (3) Inception CNNs with transfer learning. The latter achieved 0.967 accuracy and 0.970 F1 score in an indepedent test dataset, outperforming other models. This approach could support wildlife monitoring or pet identification systems.
- **Techniques**: 
    - Preprocessing: Image processing, feature engineering, normalization, dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis.
    - Modeling: Logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, sequential CNN, Inception CNN, transfer learning.
    - Evaluation: Train-validation-test split, hyperparameter tuning.
- **Tools**: Python. Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest), Scitkit-image, Keras, Tensorflow, PCA.
